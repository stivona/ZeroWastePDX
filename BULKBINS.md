### Winco
**Winco bulk 101:** Winco does not do tare weights, meaning they cannot remove the weight of your container. My best recommendation is to wash and reuse the provided plastic bags or bring a lightweight cloth bag. PDX Zero Wasters have mixed results using this method, some Winco locations do not approve of bringing your own bag whereas others seem to be fine with it. Please respect what ever you are asked to do by an employee.

### People's Food Co-op
**People's Food Co-op bulk 101:** Feel free to bring your own container. There is a scale in the bulk section. Be sure to weigh your container BEFORE you fill it and write the weight on it. Then fill 'er up and be sure to write the PLU number on your container so the cashier knows what you've got.
